# vim-config
This is my current vim config

## Steps:
1. Get git
2. Download [Vundle](http://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
3. Go into vim and run `PlugInstall` and `PluginInstall`. This will install all the plugins.
